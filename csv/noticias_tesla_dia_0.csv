Laura Bratton,Tesla stock sinks as ‘toothless’ robotaxi disappoints,Tesla stock sank after its robotaxi debut disappointed investors.,"Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 7% Friday midday as investors signaled disappointment over the EV maker’s robotaxi debut. Following the event on Thursday night, “We, Robot” — which aimed to cement CEO Elon Musk’s position as an AI leader — investors and analysts came away with more skepticism than excitement over Tesla’s lofty vision for a future of driverless cabs. Jefferies (JEF) analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets"" with “little evidence of feasibility.” “We believe TSLA potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet,” they wrote. Tesla’s new Cybercab has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous, Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian reported. The company said it will begin unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) trials with Model 3 and Model Y test vehicles next year in Texas and California. Tesla is aiming to begin Cybercab production “before 2027,” Musk said. Tesla’s stock drop on Friday extended a two-week decline. TSLA shares fell last week after the company missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. The stock — which has experienced far more volatility over the past year than its Magnificent Seven peers — is down 17% from last year. Still, TSLA’s Friday price of $220 per share is far higher than lows below $140 this spring. Shares hit a 15-month low in April amid Tesla’s layoffs and price cuts. Investors and analysts had hoped the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event would live up to the hype but were disappointed by Musk’s lack of clarity over how the company would achieve its ambitious goals. Raymond James (RJF) analyst Josh Beck called Tesla’s plan to commercialize its Cybercabs “vague” and “underwhelming.” Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts said the event included a “disappointing lack of detail” about updates to Tesla's FSD technology and market strategy. RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan concurred, writing in a note Friday that investors believe Musk’s vision “was light of real numbers and timelines.” “These typically come at Tesla events,” he added. “This one seemed focused on branding and marketing Tesla's vision, rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out.” Additionally, Tesla did not reveal details about a lower-priced vehicle as some investors had hoped. That vehicle is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, analysts noted. To be sure, some experts on Wall Street think “We, Robot” was a success. Bank of America analysts said the robotaxi event “lived up to the hype.” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note Friday, “We believe last night was a glimpse of the future of Tesla and next generation transportation for consumers.” He also noted the presence of Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus, which was “well ahead” of Wedbush expectations. Musk said Optimus could be ""[the] biggest product ever of any kind"" in terms of commercial success, Bank of America (BAC) analysts noted. The AI tech underlying the robot is the same as that used in Tesla’s vehicles. “We think this speaks to the fact that at this point TSLA is more than a traditional automotive company,” Bank of America analysts said. While noting the lack of details on Tesla’s Cybercab rollout, Wedbush’s Ives said, “[W]e strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.” The overall muted reaction to Tesla’s robotaxi launch is a good sign for ride-hailing companies Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT). “Clearly building and launching a service is the longer-term direction for Tesla but the vagueness around the service (or clarity in not saying it) may reduce fears that UBER and LYFT would have to start defending share as soon as next — which was our primary fear coming in,” RBC's Narayan said. Uber and Lyft shares both jumped around 10% Friday. Wall Street has mixed opinions on Tesla stock. Some 26 of Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying it, while 20 have a Hold rating and 15 advise investors to sell it. Overall, analysts see shares falling to $216.59 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Fred Lambert,Elon Musk wants you to believe Tesla is about to deliver self-driving without any data,"There was one big thing missing from Tesla’s autonomy event yesterday: data. Elon Musk wants you to believe Tesla is about to deliver self-driving, but you just have to believe him despite the fact that he has been wrong about it every year for the past five …","There was one big thing missing from Tesla’s autonomy event yesterday: data. Elon Musk wants you to believe Tesla is about to deliver self-driving, but you just have to believe him despite the fact that he has been wrong about it every year for the past five years. Yesterday, Tesla unveiled a cool-looking car, the Cybercab, that is entirely reliant on making Full Self-Driving (FSD) work, which was supposed to happen every year for the past 5 years, according to Elon Musk’s own statements.  Every year since 2019, Musk said that he expects Tesla to upgrade its supervised FSD into an unsupervised FSD, as promised, by the end of the year. At one point, the CEO claimed that his inaccurate timelines were due to achieving “local maximums” in the software, which they couldn’t see until they hit those ceilings. Despite this problem, he keeps giving new timelines and selling the product while Tesla could still be running into local maximums. What I wanted from Tesla’s event yesterday was to know what makes this time different. Musk said that Tesla is going to deliver unsupervised self-driving on current vehicles in California and Texas next year. Then, Cybercab will follow when it enters production in 2026 or 2027. But again, why should we believe Musk this time? I was expecting one of two things that Tesla would announce at the event to build more confidence: Tesla did neither. Instead, it’s business as usual with FSD, which currently needs a 500-1000x improvement in miles between interventions.  The latest disengagement data crowdsourced by Tesla owners shows that FSD is currently at about 123 miles between disengagement and the pace of improvement is far from impressive:  Until Tesla shows a clear path toward 100,000+ miles between disengagmeeent, a steering wheel-less robotaxi is pretty meaningless, which explains why Tesla’s stock is down by as much as 10% following the event. Instead of sharing some data about the program, which Tesla certainly has after over 1.6 billion miles on FSD, Musk decided to again only reference direct personal experiences that customers have with Tesla’s Supervised FSD. I am not discounting that Supervised FSD can be impressive, and if it was being developed in a vacuum without Musk giving unreasonable timelines and selling promises to customers for up to $15,000, I think we would all be talking differently about this product. But right now, even though you can have an impressive 100-mile drive without issue on FSD, it doesn’t translate into an unsupervised self-driving system because the data shows it can’t do it reliable thousands of times like a human could. Now, that’s based on my own experience with the system over the last 3 years and the crowdsourced data. To be fair, the crowdsourced data only accounts for ~100,000 miles while Tesla has over 1.6 billion miles of data, but if Tesla refuses to share that data, I have to assume that it doesn’t look much better than the crowdsourced dataset. The Cybercab demos at the event were less impressive than FSD. Tesla chose the Warner Bros studio for a reason.  While these roads look like regular public roads, it’s a private studio set. Tesla doesn’t need to ask California for a self-driving permit to drive there. Tesla has always resisted testing unsupervised self-driving vehicles on California roads, something all other companies developing self-driving technologies are doing. Why? Because it would require them to share their data about disengagement. Therefore, Tesla tuned FSD to work “unsupervised” on these private roads for the event. Also, I put “unsupervised” in quotes because they were unsupervised from inside the vehicle, but it looks like Tesla had staff tracking the demo vehicles and controlling their departures and arrivals. In short, Tesla needs to release its FSD data to show a clear path toward over 100,000 miles between disengagement. Otherwise, this whole thing is pretty meaningless. The Cybercab looks awesome. I love the design. The fact that it only has two seats is a bit annoying, but it’s true that 90% of rideshare rides are for two passengers or fewer. Why does a ""cab"" have only room for two people and scissor doors? How is a low-slung coupe going to help the elderly or people with disabilities who could really use autonomous transport to get somewhere?  Heck, how would it work for my wife and two kids if we needed a ride from, say, the airport to a hotel? We'd have to take two cars. That makes no sense. This thing seems half-baked. For higher volume transit, there’s the new Robovan, but it has the same FSD problem as all other Tesla vehicles.  Optimus looked to have had a meaningful improvement, but it is still ways from being useful and as per many attendees, it seems likely that there was at least a certain level of remote control.  Overall the event was very low in details and new information. It could have been an email. Looks like Tesla wanted to throw a party for its shareholders. The party that Tesla threw for its $TSLA shareholders yesterday cost them ~$50 billion dollar. pic.twitter.com/AzDHEi2uSE A party that cost them about $50 billion in valuation.

Musk arrived at the launch event at Warner Bros Studios in the fully autonomous Robotaxi, which he dubbed a ""Cybercab"". However, the star of the show was the surprise reveal of the Robovan prototype. Designed to carry 20 people, the fully autonomous Robovan has a retro-futuristic style. With its sleek form and angled facade, the Robovan has a shape that recalls the streamlined, art deco trains designed in the 1920s and 30s at the end of steam. The van has no visible front or rear windows and features a single slim headlight across its front. This extends to multiple bands that run around the vehicle. According to Musk, much like the recently released Cybertruck, the Robovan was deliberately designed to have a different aesthetic to existing vehicles. ""Now, can you imagine going down the streets and you see this coming towards you? ,"" he said at the event. ""That'd be sick."" ""One of the things we want to do, and we've seen this with the Cybertruck, is we want to change the look of the roads,"" he continued. ""The future should look like the future."" According to Musk, the vehicle is going ""to solve high density"", but could also be used to transport goods. ""So this can carry up to 20 people, and it can also transport goods,"" he said. ""The Robovan is what's going to solve high density."" ""If you want to take a sports team somewhere or you're looking to really get the cost of travel down to, I don't know, 5, 10 cents a mile, then you can use the Robovan."" Before the prototype was unveiled, Musk talked through the Robotaxi. With no steering wheels or pedals, the two-door taxi had minimal features and Cybertruck-esque styling. According to Musk, the car will cost ""below $30,000"" and be on sale in 2026 or 2027. ""We expect to be in production with the Cybercab, which is really highly optimized for autonomous transport in probably, I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames, but in 2026,"" he said. ""So, yeah, before 2027, let me put it that way. And we'll make this vehicle in very high volume."" Last year Tesla released the futuristic-looking Cybertruck.

If you read something you like, something you don't like but are glad to know about, and/or something you can't find anywhere else consider a one-time tip. It all goes in the same pot and it all goes to the editorial team. Thanks for your support! Good Morning, Portland! It's shaping up to be a pleasant day—weather-wise. That good fortune will continue until next week when IT WILL RAIN FOR DAYS. Bring it; I love it. AND NOW let's get into the NEWS TO LOVE OR NOT LOVE OR EVEN HATE. IN LOCAL NEWS:• Researchers at Brown University released a paper last month concluding that ""decriminalization of drug possession was not associated with an increase in fatal drug overdose rates in Oregon."" Read the university's digest here or find it on JAMA Network Open. • Today is opening day for the Marie Equi Day Center, Portland's new day center dedicated specifically to serving queer and trans residents. While Marie Equi has existed as a nonprofit for a decade, operating out of the Q Center, this expansion represents a new chapter, as the organization works to respond to a notable influx of queer and trans folks moving to our state. At the 13,000-square-foot center Marie Equi staff will continue to help people navigate social service systems, but will now be able to also offers showers, laundry services, a gymnasium, food pantry, kitchenette, computer lab, reading nook, and art space to those in need. There's so much more to the story—read Anna Del Savio's report for the Mercury. • The Oregonian continues to review mayoral candidate City Commissioner Carmen Rubio’s parking and traffic tickets. And they want you to know that, while Rubio has told multiple media outlets that the tickets are the result of working in an over-patrolled area—accumulating 150 violations over the course of two decades—she actually received only a third of the citations around that location.  Rubio response: “In American public life, women can’t seem to apologize enough for our mistakes. While our male counterparts’ past—or recent—mistakes are minimized as youthful indiscretions or ‘poor judgment,’ women aren’t afforded that same forgiveness.""https://t.co/Mf49g3NQou https://t.co/lx6cxhoFin    • Kind of weird that Willamette Week wrote about Rene Gonzalez' speeding tickets, license suspension, and citation for not paying for MAX, but the Oregonian never did a dedicated story about it? Just mentioned WW's reporting in the Rubio story? Am I wrong? I can't find it. • Also in Rene Gonzalez news, he's calling for Portland Police Bureau to increase its police for to 1,000 officers, ideally 1,200. Oregonian criminal justice reporter Max Bernstein reports that PPB, as of the beginning of this month, has 881 authorized positions in the city budget. It ""hasn’t approached an 1,000-officer force for more than two decades."" • Surrealism break! Just saw this little cutie scuttle into the race. Rank Raccoon for Mayor! Finally issues that resonate with me[image or embed]    • We were pretty blown away by folk musician Jeffery Martin at this year's Pickathon, and now he's recording a live album at Mississippi Studios as part of a fall tour. Ben Salmon introduces the artist and the event in this profile for the Mercury. A post shared by Portland Mercury (@portlandmercury) • Looking to for this week's super fun news trivia quiz? Look no further! In the mix from recent relevant mischief: Loitering Coyotes, Sleepy Volcanoes, and Other Things to PANIC About! IN NATIONAL / INTERNATIONAL NEWS:• Today's top national / international story is NPR Unlocking TikTok Docs. God bless you, administrative errors. Over the course of the last two years, attorneys general in 14 US states kept internal communications, documents, and research data gathered from the social media platform redacted, as part of confidentiality agreements the authorities had struck with TikTok. That information was blacked out and unreadable... at least until Kentucky Public Radio staff realized they could copy and paste the redacted text into a readable format! The material TikTok sought to keep confidential reveals the platform's research on its own app estimates ""users can become ‘addicted’ in 35 minutes"" or 260 videos and shows TikTok knows its product is harmful for teens, purposely promotes users it deems attractive, and that its plans for its time-limit tool were about improving public trust, not actually cutting down on app use (of course). Read NPR's whole exposé here. • Even as researchers try to estimate the damage wrought by Hurricane Milton, photographers on the scene are doing that same work of showing the scale. AP PHOTOS: Powerful Hurricane Milton destroys homes, shreds stadium roofs apart https://t.co/7TIylXADwF    • A new, deeply-stupid-looking vehicle from Tesla: Elon Musk unveiled the Robovan at Tesla's We, Robot event saying “the future should look like the future."" Musk said the Robovan can carry up to 20 people and also transport goods, and that it will solve for high density. pic.twitter.com/ltI0kmS97R    • If you're following the Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs allegations, NPR has compiled a list of ""everyone caught in the web of the Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs allegations so far."" • Sending you into the weekend with this masterful play-by-play—although that lady is obvs driving a sedan, not an SUV.

The broad index gained 0.61% to end at 5,815.03, while the Dow rallied 409.74 points, or 0.97%, to finish at 42,863.86. Both averages hit fresh all-time highs and closed at records. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.33% to finish at 18,342.94 and less than 2% below its all-time high. ""What we're seeing — and I think you're seeing it hit pretty hard today, in a good way — is a broadening of the market,"" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Amundi US. The major averages also registered a fifth straight week of gains. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped 1.1% each, while the Dow toted a 1.2% gain. A strong start to the third-quarter earnings season provided a lift to stocks. JPMorgan Chase rose 4.4% after topping profit and revenue expectations, while Wells Fargo popped 5.6% on stronger-than-expected profits. Investors overlooked disappointing revenue and an 11% decline in net interest income. ""Net interest income used to be the bellwether of whether [a] bank is doing well or not,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. ""Investors have comprehended that they'll make money in good times and bad."" Wall Street tends to view the banking sector as a barometer for the health of economy, setting the tone for the remainder of the earnings season. However, Forrest notes they lack the visibility into forward guidance that often affects the postearnings stock moves. Stocks also benefited from data that alleviated fears that inflation was not cooling off quickly enough. That included a cooler-than-expected September producer price index reading after the consumer price index increased slightly more than expected. The findings signaled that the Federal Reserve may in fact attain a soft landing scenario and reach its 2% goal, which Goldman Sachs economists think upcoming September inflation data may already show. ""Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates,"" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. ""The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings."" Fed funds futures trading suggests a nearly 90% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will dial back interest rates by a quarter point in November, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Central bank policymakers will keep a close eye on additional data, which will shape their course on rates. Elsewhere, Tesla shares tanked 8.8% on the back of an underwhelming robotaxi event. Stocks finished higher for a fifth straight week. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% to end at 5,815.03, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 409.74 points, or nearly 1%, to finish at 42,863.86. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.33% to finish at 18,342.94 and less than 2% below its all-time high. — Samantha Subin Recent storms and the port strikes can bleed into the economic data releases that investors and Federal Reserve officials closely monitor, according to Jim Reid, head of global economics and thematic research at Deutsche Bank. ""We are in for a period of data heavily influenced by recent storms and strikes,"" he said. ""So this will likely make it a complicated few weeks for markets and the Fed."" Additionally, he noted that the narrative has ""changed a bit"" after last week's blockbuster jobs report and Thursday's consumer price index reading. ""The view I've felt most certain of was that the market was massively overpricing the perfect scenario of smooth enough data that the Fed would be able to serenely cut rates back below 3% without a recession,"" he said. ""If we don't get a recession, it's hard to see how rates can be cut anywhere near as aggressively as this."" — Alex Harring Bitcoin on Friday rose in a broad market rally of risk assets following strong bank earnings. The price of the flagship cryptocurrency rose more than 6% to above $63,000, according to Coin Metrics. It was on pace for its best day since Aug. 8 and to snap a 3-day losing streak. ""Digital assets tend to rally in tandem with equities, and the Dow is up 400 points today. Risk-on trades often benefit BTC and ETH, and parabolically so - today's significant price gains are a further continuation of this long-established trend, especially with expectations of a Fed rate cut in November, said Chris Chung, co-founder and CEO at Solana liquidity aggregator Titan. Crypto stocks Coinbase and MicroStrategy jumped 8% and 15%, respectively. — Tanaya Macheel, Nick Wells Despite heightened volatility heading into the U.S. presidential election, UBS is very bullish on the upcoming earnings season. In fact, the bank believes strong reports from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and BlackRock on Friday morning should set the precedent for a solid earnings season that is ""consistent with recent, healthy trends."" ""While headline S&P 500 EPS growth will likely slow to about 5-7% (from 11% in 2Q), a large portion of the slowdown is coming from the energy sector due to lower oil and gasoline prices. Excluding the energy sector, S&P 500 profit growth should be 8-10%,"" the bank wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, profit growth is expected to broaden out, but UBS still thinks the ""Magnificent Seven"" cohort will lead. CNBC Pro subscribers can read the full story here. — Lisa Kailai Han Information technology was on pace to finish the week as the S&P 500's top outperforming sector. Tech was last up about 2.6% week to date, led by Super Micro Computer and Palo Alto Network's weekly gains of more than 15% and 9%, respectively. Industrials and financials were the following best-performing sectors on the week, up 1.8% each.
