Sean Burch,Elon Musk Is Prepared to Spend at Least $140 Million to Help Elect Donald Trump,"The New York Times says the X and Tesla boss is ""obsessive, almost manic"" about the former president beating Kamala Harris 
The post Elon Musk Is Prepared to Spend at Least $140 Million to Help Elect Donald Trump appeared first on TheWrap.","The New York Times says the X and Tesla boss is “obsessive, almost manic” about the former president beating Kamala Harris  Tesla boss Elon Musk is spending big to help Donald Trump get back in the White House.  The New York Times on Friday reported Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC, dubbed the America PAC, has “spent about $80 million” so far this campaign. But that figure may soon be updated to show anywhere between $140 million and $180 million spent on helping the Republican candidate. Here’s the key section from the NYT story: “The scale of Mr. Musk’s personal financial commitment will not be made public until the middle of [October]. Initially, Mr. Musk and his friends in the group had spoken of a budget totaling from $140 million to $180 million, almost all it from Mr. Musk himself. The group has told other prospective donors in recent weeks that it is fully funded.” Musk has been open about his support for the former president in recent months. He publicly endorsed Trump after his first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. Since then, he’s posted on X in favor of Trump, hosted a live conversation with him on X Spaces in August and joined the reality TV show host-turned-politician on stage when he returned to Butler last weekend. “President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,” Musk said at Trump’s rally last week. “He must win to preserve democracy in America.”  The Times, in its Friday story, called Musk’s support of Trump “obsessive, almost manic.”  America PAC’s website, which includes a picture of Musk in his “dark MAGA” hat, lists a handful of top priorities, including free speech, safe cities and secure borders. The PAC is focused on knocking on doors in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with a goal of getting 800,000 to 1 million citizens to vote for Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has a number of big-name billionaires backing her, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.  Harris has raised $1 billion in less than three months since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.  Your email address will not be published.

Laura Bratton,Tesla stock sinks as ‘toothless’ robotaxi disappoints,Tesla stock sank after its robotaxi debut disappointed investors.,"Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 7% Friday midday as investors signaled disappointment over the EV maker’s robotaxi debut. Following the event on Thursday night, “We, Robot” — which aimed to cement CEO Elon Musk’s position as an AI leader — investors and analysts came away with more skepticism than excitement over Tesla’s lofty vision for a future of driverless cabs. Jefferies (JEF) analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets"" with “little evidence of feasibility.” “We believe TSLA potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet,” they wrote. Tesla’s new Cybercab has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous, Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian reported. The company said it will begin unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) trials with Model 3 and Model Y test vehicles next year in Texas and California. Tesla is aiming to begin Cybercab production “before 2027,” Musk said. Tesla’s stock drop on Friday extended a two-week decline. TSLA shares fell last week after the company missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. The stock — which has experienced far more volatility over the past year than its Magnificent Seven peers — is down 17% from last year. Still, TSLA’s Friday price of $220 per share is far higher than lows below $140 this spring. Shares hit a 15-month low in April amid Tesla’s layoffs and price cuts. Investors and analysts had hoped the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event would live up to the hype but were disappointed by Musk’s lack of clarity over how the company would achieve its ambitious goals. Raymond James (RJF) analyst Josh Beck called Tesla’s plan to commercialize its Cybercabs “vague” and “underwhelming.” Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts said the event included a “disappointing lack of detail” about updates to Tesla's FSD technology and market strategy. RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan concurred, writing in a note Friday that investors believe Musk’s vision “was light of real numbers and timelines.” “These typically come at Tesla events,” he added. “This one seemed focused on branding and marketing Tesla's vision, rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out.” Additionally, Tesla did not reveal details about a lower-priced vehicle as some investors had hoped. That vehicle is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, analysts noted. To be sure, some experts on Wall Street think “We, Robot” was a success. Bank of America analysts said the robotaxi event “lived up to the hype.” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note Friday, “We believe last night was a glimpse of the future of Tesla and next generation transportation for consumers.” He also noted the presence of Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus, which was “well ahead” of Wedbush expectations. Musk said Optimus could be ""[the] biggest product ever of any kind"" in terms of commercial success, Bank of America (BAC) analysts noted. The AI tech underlying the robot is the same as that used in Tesla’s vehicles. “We think this speaks to the fact that at this point TSLA is more than a traditional automotive company,” Bank of America analysts said. While noting the lack of details on Tesla’s Cybercab rollout, Wedbush’s Ives said, “[W]e strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.” The overall muted reaction to Tesla’s robotaxi launch is a good sign for ride-hailing companies Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT). “Clearly building and launching a service is the longer-term direction for Tesla but the vagueness around the service (or clarity in not saying it) may reduce fears that UBER and LYFT would have to start defending share as soon as next — which was our primary fear coming in,” RBC's Narayan said. Uber and Lyft shares both jumped around 10% Friday. Wall Street has mixed opinions on Tesla stock. Some 26 of Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying it, while 20 have a Hold rating and 15 advise investors to sell it. Overall, analysts see shares falling to $216.59 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Fred Lambert,Elon Musk wants you to believe Tesla is about to deliver self-driving without any data,"There was one big thing missing from Tesla’s autonomy event yesterday: data. Elon Musk wants you to believe Tesla is about to deliver self-driving, but you just have to believe him despite the fact that he has been wrong about it every year for the past five …","There was one big thing missing from Tesla’s autonomy event yesterday: data. Elon Musk wants you to believe Tesla is about to deliver self-driving, but you just have to believe him despite the fact that he has been wrong about it every year for the past five years. Yesterday, Tesla unveiled a cool-looking car, the Cybercab, that is entirely reliant on making Full Self-Driving (FSD) work, which was supposed to happen every year for the past 5 years, according to Elon Musk’s own statements.  Every year since 2019, Musk said that he expects Tesla to upgrade its supervised FSD into an unsupervised FSD, as promised, by the end of the year. At one point, the CEO claimed that his inaccurate timelines were due to achieving “local maximums” in the software, which they couldn’t see until they hit those ceilings. Despite this problem, he keeps giving new timelines and selling the product while Tesla could still be running into local maximums. What I wanted from Tesla’s event yesterday was to know what makes this time different. Musk said that Tesla is going to deliver unsupervised self-driving on current vehicles in California and Texas next year. Then, Cybercab will follow when it enters production in 2026 or 2027. But again, why should we believe Musk this time? I was expecting one of two things that Tesla would announce at the event to build more confidence: Tesla did neither. Instead, it’s business as usual with FSD, which currently needs a 500-1000x improvement in miles between interventions.  The latest disengagement data crowdsourced by Tesla owners shows that FSD is currently at about 123 miles between disengagement and the pace of improvement is far from impressive:  Until Tesla shows a clear path toward 100,000+ miles between disengagmeeent, a steering wheel-less robotaxi is pretty meaningless, which explains why Tesla’s stock is down by as much as 10% following the event. Instead of sharing some data about the program, which Tesla certainly has after over 1.6 billion miles on FSD, Musk decided to again only reference direct personal experiences that customers have with Tesla’s Supervised FSD. I am not discounting that Supervised FSD can be impressive, and if it was being developed in a vacuum without Musk giving unreasonable timelines and selling promises to customers for up to $15,000, I think we would all be talking differently about this product. But right now, even though you can have an impressive 100-mile drive without issue on FSD, it doesn’t translate into an unsupervised self-driving system because the data shows it can’t do it reliable thousands of times like a human could. Now, that’s based on my own experience with the system over the last 3 years and the crowdsourced data. To be fair, the crowdsourced data only accounts for ~100,000 miles while Tesla has over 1.6 billion miles of data, but if Tesla refuses to share that data, I have to assume that it doesn’t look much better than the crowdsourced dataset. The Cybercab demos at the event were less impressive than FSD. Tesla chose the Warner Bros studio for a reason.  While these roads look like regular public roads, it’s a private studio set. Tesla doesn’t need to ask California for a self-driving permit to drive there. Tesla has always resisted testing unsupervised self-driving vehicles on California roads, something all other companies developing self-driving technologies are doing. Why? Because it would require them to share their data about disengagement. Therefore, Tesla tuned FSD to work “unsupervised” on these private roads for the event. Also, I put “unsupervised” in quotes because they were unsupervised from inside the vehicle, but it looks like Tesla had staff tracking the demo vehicles and controlling their departures and arrivals. In short, Tesla needs to release its FSD data to show a clear path toward over 100,000 miles between disengagement. Otherwise, this whole thing is pretty meaningless. The Cybercab looks awesome. I love the design. The fact that it only has two seats is a bit annoying, but it’s true that 90% of rideshare rides are for two passengers or fewer. Why does a ""cab"" have only room for two people and scissor doors? How is a low-slung coupe going to help the elderly or people with disabilities who could really use autonomous transport to get somewhere?  Heck, how would it work for my wife and two kids if we needed a ride from, say, the airport to a hotel? We'd have to take two cars. That makes no sense. This thing seems half-baked. For higher volume transit, there’s the new Robovan, but it has the same FSD problem as all other Tesla vehicles.  Optimus looked to have had a meaningful improvement, but it is still ways from being useful and as per many attendees, it seems likely that there was at least a certain level of remote control.  Overall the event was very low in details and new information. It could have been an email. Looks like Tesla wanted to throw a party for its shareholders. The party that Tesla threw for its $TSLA shareholders yesterday cost them ~$50 billion dollar. pic.twitter.com/AzDHEi2uSE A party that cost them about $50 billion in valuation.

Musk arrived at the launch event at Warner Bros Studios in the fully autonomous Robotaxi, which he dubbed a ""Cybercab"". However, the star of the show was the surprise reveal of the Robovan prototype. Designed to carry 20 people, the fully autonomous Robovan has a retro-futuristic style. With its sleek form and angled facade, the Robovan has a shape that recalls the streamlined, art deco trains designed in the 1920s and 30s at the end of steam. The van has no visible front or rear windows and features a single slim headlight across its front. This extends to multiple bands that run around the vehicle. According to Musk, much like the recently released Cybertruck, the Robovan was deliberately designed to have a different aesthetic to existing vehicles. ""Now, can you imagine going down the streets and you see this coming towards you? ,"" he said at the event. ""That'd be sick."" ""One of the things we want to do, and we've seen this with the Cybertruck, is we want to change the look of the roads,"" he continued. ""The future should look like the future."" According to Musk, the vehicle is going ""to solve high density"", but could also be used to transport goods. ""So this can carry up to 20 people, and it can also transport goods,"" he said. ""The Robovan is what's going to solve high density."" ""If you want to take a sports team somewhere or you're looking to really get the cost of travel down to, I don't know, 5, 10 cents a mile, then you can use the Robovan."" Before the prototype was unveiled, Musk talked through the Robotaxi. With no steering wheels or pedals, the two-door taxi had minimal features and Cybertruck-esque styling. According to Musk, the car will cost ""below $30,000"" and be on sale in 2026 or 2027. ""We expect to be in production with the Cybercab, which is really highly optimized for autonomous transport in probably, I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames, but in 2026,"" he said. ""So, yeah, before 2027, let me put it that way. And we'll make this vehicle in very high volume."" Last year Tesla released the futuristic-looking Cybertruck.

IN LOCAL NEWS:• Researchers at Brown University released a paper last month concluding that ""decriminalization of drug possession was not associated with an increase in fatal drug overdose rates in Oregon."" Read the university's digest here or find it on JAMA Network Open. • Today is opening day for the Marie Equi Day Center, Portland's new day center dedicated specifically to serving queer and trans residents. While Marie Equi has existed as a nonprofit for a decade, operating out of the Q Center, this expansion represents a new chapter, as the organization works to respond to a notable influx of queer and trans folks moving to our state. At the 13,000-square-foot center Marie Equi staff will continue to help people navigate social service systems, but will now be able to also offers showers, laundry services, a gymnasium, food pantry, kitchenette, computer lab, reading nook, and art space to those in need. There's so much more to the story—read Anna Del Savio's report for the Mercury. • The Oregonian continues to review mayoral candidate City Commissioner Carmen Rubio’s parking and traffic tickets. And they want you to know that, while Rubio has told multiple media outlets that the tickets are the result of working in an over-patrolled area—accumulating 150 violations over the course of two decades—she actually received only a third of the citations around that location.  Rubio response: “In American public life, women can’t seem to apologize enough for our mistakes. While our male counterparts’ past—or recent—mistakes are minimized as youthful indiscretions or ‘poor judgment,’ women aren’t afforded that same forgiveness.""https://t.co/Mf49g3NQou https://t.co/lx6cxhoFin    • Kind of weird that Willamette Week wrote about Rene Gonzalez' speeding tickets, license suspension, and citation for not paying for MAX, but the Oregonian never did a dedicated story about it? Just mentioned WW's reporting in the Rubio story? Am I wrong? I can't find it. • Also in Rene Gonzalez news, he's calling for Portland Police Bureau to increase its police for to 1,000 officers, ideally 1,200. Oregonian criminal justice reporter Max Bernstein reports that PPB, as of the beginning of this month, has 881 authorized positions in the city budget. It ""hasn’t approached an 1,000-officer force for more than two decades."" • Surrealism break! Just saw this little cutie scuttle into the race. Rank Raccoon for Mayor! Finally issues that resonate with me[image or embed]    • We were pretty blown away by folk musician Jeffery Martin at this year's Pickathon, and now he's recording a live album at Mississippi Studios as part of a fall tour. Ben Salmon introduces the artist and the event in this profile for the Mercury. A post shared by Portland Mercury (@portlandmercury) • Looking to for this week's super fun news trivia quiz? Look no further! In the mix from recent relevant mischief: Loitering Coyotes, Sleepy Volcanoes, and Other Things to PANIC About! IN NATIONAL / INTERNATIONAL NEWS:• Today's top national / international story is NPR Unlocking TikTok Docs. God bless you, administrative errors. Over the course of the last two years, attorneys general in 14 US states kept internal communications, documents, and research data gathered from the social media platform redacted, as part of confidentiality agreements the authorities had struck with TikTok. That information was blacked out and unreadable... at least until Kentucky Public Radio staff realized they could copy and paste the redacted text into a readable format! The material TikTok sought to keep confidential reveals the platform's research on its own app estimates ""users can become ‘addicted’ in 35 minutes"" or 260 videos and shows TikTok knows its product is harmful for teens, purposely promotes users it deems attractive, and that its plans for its time-limit tool were about improving public trust, not actually cutting down on app use (of course). Read NPR's whole exposé here. • Even as researchers try to estimate the damage wrought by Hurricane Milton, photographers on the scene are doing that same work of showing the scale.
