The event\u2019s afterparty heavily featured Optimus as a bartender and dancer, but it turns out the bot wasn\u2019t doing anything itself. Tesla employees were remote controlling it the whole time.  Robert Scoble, an AI enthusiast in attendance at the event, posted a video to Twitter of Optimus pouring drinks and waving to attendees. A second video, in which Scoble has a conversation with the bot\u2019s operator and directly addresses the question of whether Optimus did anything autonomously at the party. The answer appears to be a resounding no.  The fact that Optimus could carry on a conversation, alone, is a sign that the bot was primarily being remote controlled.

That\u2019s the kind of thing you say when you\u2019re trying to pretend like you\u2019re using any AI at all.  This robot, which so far seems to primarily operate by human remote control, remains Elon Musk\u2019s vision for the future of Tesla as a company. Since Musk\u2019s investor call admission that he sees no limit to the amount of money people will spend on robots, Optimus has been his baby \u2014 far more so than any of the eugenicist\u2019s actual human children.

Owners of Infinitis and Nissans in LAkeep having their cars stolen to be used in takeovers. The cars are later found either wrecked or burned. It isn\u2019t exactly common for automobile manufacturers to focus on continued development of its decades-old long-dead product lines, but Porsche is serious about keeping its Carrera GT owners happy. Porsche factory racing driver Joerg Bergmeister worked directly with Michelin to develop a new sticky tire specifically formulated to make the car even better now than it was at the time it launched in 2003.

Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s latest concert moment has taken the internet by storm after a hilarious interaction with a fan went viral. Timelapse footage showed a swimming pool at a Florida resort flood as Hurricane Milton swept across the state's west coast. Footage from the Pink Shell Beach Resort and Marina on Wednesday showed the pool churn, while palm trees were blown around in the background. I'm sure you remember when you dared to be different and what it felt like when people didn't accept you. At Elon Musk's 'We, Robot' event, 2 Chainz and Swae Lee interacted with a Tesla Optimus robot, prompting it to sing Swae's hit \"Sunflower.\" She's still, she's still Jenny from the Block. Used to have a little, now she's got a lot. \"My community won\u2019t have electricity for a long time.\" RHOC's Jennifer Pedranti and Ryan Boyajian have Shannon Storms Beador coming to their defense.

JPMorgan's net income fell 2% in the third quarter as the bank had to set aside more money to cover bad loans, but the results topped Wall Street estimates and shares rose in morning trading.  The result beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 forecasts, which called for a profit of $3.99 a share, according to FactSet.  JPMorgan set aside $3.1 billion to cover credit losses, up from $1.4 billion in the same period a year ago. Three people in California were arrested after police say they conspired to steal $200,000 in cash from a couple in February. One of Wall Street's hottest AI stocks may get another boost. Is now the time to buy? A severe geomagnetic storm brought spectacular light displays to many parts of the United States on Thursday night, with skies as far south as San Antonio bathed in rich hues of magenta and green. We've all committed at least one of these mistakes. Trump has not mentioned any such offer for his supporters. Versions of the claim circulated with a note describing it as intentional misinformation. The phrase \"the one percent\" gets tossed around a lot in conversations about wealth and inequality, whether in politics, protests, or everyday chats. But what does it mean to be in the top 1%?

       "Conteudo":"Editions: En\/lifestyle\/us-news The Optimus will walk amongst us Tesla's recent Cybercab event was nothing short of spectacular, especially with the introduction of their humanoid Optimus robots. Walking out alongside the unveiling of the new Robovan, these bots showcased their potential by performing everyday tasks like delivering packages and watering plants. Elon Musk excitedly declared that \"the Optimus will walk amongst you,\" hinting at a future where these robots are part of our daily lives, serving drinks and assisting with household chores. Musk's vision for Optimus is ambitious; he claims these robots could essentially \"do anything,\" from walking dogs to babysitting children, all at an estimated price of $20,000 to $30,000. As the event progressed, attendees were thrilled to see the bots interact with the crowd, waving and engaging in fun activities like rock, paper, scissors. One particularly entertaining segment featured a group of dancing robots in a gazebo, captivating everyone with their moves. While the Optimus robots brought excitement, they also showcased Tesla's evolving vision for the future. Musk revealed plans for a lighter, faster Gen 2 model, emphasizing that these bots will start performing \"useful tasks\" by the end of the year and may be available for purchase by next year. It's clear that Musk sees a world transformed by these machines, promising a \"fundamental transformation for civilization\" and suggesting that they could lead to economic improvements on a massive scale. Initially unveiled in 2021 with a playful dance by a man in a robot suit, the Optimus project has come a long way since then. The journey from a crude prototype to a robot capable of engaging in real interactions demonstrates Tesla's commitment to innovation. As Musk continues to set high expectations for the future of robotics, it seems that the Optimus bot could become a game-changer, paving the way for a lifestyle where technology seamlessly integrates into our daily routines. \u00a9  Unidad Editorial Informaci\u00f3n Deportiva, S.L.U.

       "Descricao":"Once seen as a real-life Iron Man, the Tesla chief has morphed into a total Trump fanboy\u2014and admits he\u2019ll be \u201cf--ked\u201d if the former president loses. Will he use X to throw a wrench in the works if Harris wins?",
       "Conteudo":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. For years, Elon Musk liked to think of himself as a real-life Marvel superhero, a Tony Stark\u2013esque genius who would save humanity from its greatest threats. He dressed like a superhero for Halloween. He once seemingly compared himself to Batman in a tweet. He was repeatedly called \u201cthe real-life Iron Man\u201d in the media, and even made a cameo in Iron Man 2, reveling in the comparisons between him and a superhero. But the past few years have shown a different version of Musk\u2014one more akin to a comic book supervillain who undergoes a dark transformation. Picture Spider-Man donning the all-black symbiote suit or Superman losing his moral compass. Yes, he\u2019s gone through one of those classic transformations, and the shift seemed ironically complete when he appeared onstage at a Donald Trump rally this past weekend in Butler, Pennsylvania, wearing a black \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and proudly declaring, \u201cI\u2019m dark MAGA,\u201d before literally jumping up and down. Now, I have no problem with people declaring their allegiance to Trump. We all have our political viewpoints. People may be voting for Trump because of their staunch belief in the Second Amendment, or because they\u2019re drawn in by his promise of lower taxes (for the rich), or because they\u2019re antiabortion, or because they\u2019re steadfast supporters of Israel\u2014or because they just hate Kamala Harris. But none of these reasons really apply to Musk, and the question that people can\u2019t stop asking about him is: why? Is this about lower taxes? Did Harris kill his puppy when they were younger? Call him a bad name? Make fun of his hair? What exactly is it that made Musk transform from a Democrat-supporting champion of renewable energy and free speech to a Trump supporter and cultural warrior? What made him go from talking about the science of renewable energy and solar power to shilling conspiracy theories about the government\u2019s Hurricane Helene response and baseless claims that undocumented immigrants are being used by Democrats to steal elections? While it\u2019s tempting to frame Musk\u2019s recent embrace of far-right views as a strategic move tied to financial incentives or corporate interests, the former poster child for progressive ideals\u2014who was arguably one of the most influential people fighting against climate change\u2014appears to have made this ideological pivot for far more personal reasons. As one Silicon Valley insider put it to me: \u201cThis started when he became angry at authorities during COVID, when they forced him to close his car plants, and then he was truly radicalized about social issues by his daughter\u2019s decision to transition.\u201d The nail in the superhero coffin, it appears, was when she fought back against him in public, calling her father a \u201cserial adulterer\u201d and his actions \u201cbeyond stupid\u201d and \u201cdesperate.\u201d (To be fair, plenty of people have used one of those words against their parents before.) Indeed, during the pandemic, Musk publicly fought against local government restrictions, particularly those imposed in Alameda County, California, which forced him to shut down Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory. Defiantly, he reopened the factory in May 2020 against local orders, even tweeting, \u201cIf anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.\u201d (That may have seemed like a brave move, but it was really just chest-thumping; Musk knew full well that the United States wasn\u2019t going to toss the richest man on earth in jail.) But that moment really fanned the flames, making Musk irate\u2014not at the situation (in which tens of thousands of people were dying from COVID), but rather at Democratic state officials who were dictating what he could or couldn\u2019t do with his factories, which he saw as an affront to his autonomy and his businesses\u2019 survival. If you imagine Musk\u2019s views as a tightly woven fabric, this was the moment when you could see the first thread start to unravel. The COVID confrontation marked the beginning of Musk\u2019s detachment from the left-leaning politics of California, which he came to see as an obstacle to his success. Then, in 2022, he purchased Twitter. That\u2019s when his views started to flip-flop in all directions. One moment he was for free speech\u2014 declaring himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d\u2014and the next thing you know, he was suspending accounts and reinstating some previously banned users (like Trump), managing to silence those who criticized him, including users who impersonated him and journalists he found annoying. While he said he voted for Joe Biden in 2020, Musk endorsed Trump\u2014whom he previously urged to \u201csail into the sunset\u201d\u2014in the immediate aftermath of the July assassination attempt. Oh, and there are his foreign policy takes: From suggesting that Ukraine give Crimea to Russia to proposing that Taiwan be made a \u201cspecial administrative zone\u201d of China, it\u2019s as if Musk fancies himself a one-man United Nations, solving conflicts with the wisdom of a Twitter poll. To call Musk inconsistent would be generous\u2014he\u2019s more like a wind sock, blown about by whatever personal vendetta is closest to his heart at the time. Which brings us to the impetus for the complete tearing of the thread that tied Musk to the left. The theory in Silicon Valley is that the thing that made him feel like he\u2019d been \u201cred-pilled\u201d was not an attempt on Trump\u2019s life, or his own taxes, but actually a family rift that spilled into the public eye. This goes back to 2022, when his daughter Vivian came out as transgender and sought to legally change her last name from Musk to Wilson, citing her desire to have no relationship whatsoever with her father. In a court filing, she wrote: \u201cI no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.\u201d The painful estrangement clearly left Musk feeling abandoned, and he blamed the entire thing on \u201cthe woke mind virus,\u201d a term he now uses to describe progressive social values he sees as destructive. In his eyes, the left\u2014which he once applauded, and whose members were the main purchasers of his innovations and ideals\u2014had now taken away his child. (Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of Musk suggests that this event played a major role in catalyzing his shift toward more extreme political views.) Now, if you\u2019re Elon Musk and someone attacks you publicly, you come after them with all the might of your 200 million-plus followers, and often even your lawyers. And while he did say that Vivian was \u201cdead\u201d to him, he couldn\u2019t really take his daughter to task publicly, because that would be a step too far for the man who earned the name Space Karen. So instead, he appears to have decided to attack the entire Democratic Party, while giving tens of millions to support Republican candidates and causes. As they say in the movie industry, CUT TO last weekend, when Musk came out onstage at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally in his black MAGA hat, proclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m dark MAGA!\u201d While Musk is clearly Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleader in the tech community (even more so than the fawning All-In podcast posse, who had him on their show and didn\u2019t ask many substantive questions), he is far from the only person who has been red-pilled in Silicon Valley, and there are many (at least behind the scenes) who are actually cheering him on. \u201cWhile many Americans feel Trump is a severe threat to democracy, there are plenty of people out there who believe that the woke mind virus, also known as the 2024 Democratic Party\u2014the extremist flank of which has taken to cosplaying terrorists on college campuses\u2014is a greater threat to democracy than even Donald Trump,\u201d said one Silicon Valley investor. \u201cAnd Elon, I believe, falls squarely into that camp.\u201d The big question is, now what? Musk\u2019s trajectory toward Trumpism and far-right ideologies is deeply personal\u2014a reaction to perceived injustices inflicted by those he once considered ideological allies. Musk has to figure out how to reconcile promising us a greener future and embracing a party that says climate science isn\u2019t real. And even Musk knows this could all backfire spectacularly if voters choose a different path. This week, on his own platform, he sat for an interview during which host Tucker Carlson said, \u201cIf he loses, man\u2026 You\u2019re fucked, dude,\u201d to which Musk candidly admitted, \u201cI\u2019m fucked. If he loses, I\u2019m fucked,\u201d while (perhaps nervously) laughing. If Trump does lose, he\u2019s likely to deny the election results again, and while Trump would inevitably take to social media to question every vote, it\u2019s Musk\u2014who owns X and has the power to decide which vote-related conspiracy theories are allowed on the site\u2014who would play a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine the democratic process. Instead of banning any baseless claims, Musk would likely be the one amplifying them to the more than 200 million who follow him, fueling the narrative and ensuring that the conspiracy theories reach as many people as possible. In the end, Musk\u2019s journey from a visionary hero to a \u201cdark MAGA\u201d antihero is our own fault. Maybe we looked at Musk as the superhero, and later the villain, when in reality, he was neither; rather, he was the guy financing the bad guy, which, let\u2019s be honest, isn\u2019t exactly the sexiest role in a superhero movie. But the thing about that guy is, he\u2019s often driven by personal vendettas, bruised egos, and shifting loyalties. That guy\u2019s transformation is less about ideology and more about resentment\u2014toward government control, toward personal rejection, and toward a world that didn\u2019t bend to his will. And as with any good comic book character, the winds may shift yet again\u2014because if there\u2019s one thing we know about Musk, it\u2019s that the wind sock that is his point of view will change directions once more.

       "Conteudo":"U.Today - Michael Saylor, cofounder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, has taken to his account of the X social media network to issue a regular Bitcoin-themed tweet with an image. This time, however, the topic of his tweet is not only BTC. The message and the image seem to be a reaction to the recent presentation of Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi\/Cybercab made by its CEO, Elon Musk, on Oct. 10. This event was called \u201cWe, Robot\u2026\u201d referring to a movie starring Will Smith based on Isaac Asimov\u2019s sci-fi stories.  It seems to be a bullish reaction to the recent event staged by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk. Musk presented unsupervised self-driving Cybertrucks that are going to be used as taxis. Musk gave a speech, in which he criticized the modern transportation system, which seems inefficient because of high traffic and other issues. Robotaxis\/Cybercabs do not have a steering wheel or pedals, and they do not require any control from passengers whatsoever. Earlier, Musk stated that users would be able to allow their Tesla cars to be used as taxis since, on average, a car is not used that frequently per week.  Aside from Cybercabs, the guests of the event also witnessed the appearance of Tesla-made androids called Tesla Optimus (\u201cautonomous assistant, humanoid friend\u201d). One of them even worked as a bartender, making cocktails and dressed correspondingly, also wearing a fedora hat and letting clients take a selfie with it. The robot showed a peace sign with his fingers while photos were taken. This article was originally published on U.Today",
